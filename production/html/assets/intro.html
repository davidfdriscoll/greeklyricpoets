         <h4>Mapping Greek Lyric: Places, Travel, Geographical Imaginary</h4>
		 <p>This project is the first-ever attempt to illustrate on an interactive map key aspects of the rich lyric production that was generated and spread throughout the Greek world from the 7th to the beginning of the 4th century BC. The composition of melic, elegiac and iambic poetry, all included here under the term lyric, was a crucial component of Greek musical cultures. As mousike, with its various combinations of vocal, instrumental and kinetic activity, was a cornerstone in forming sensibilities and establishing ideologies, our project aspires to be a useful tool for all those interested in exploring the local origins and mobile dynamics of performance and culture in the ancient world.</p>
