replacing tables

you can't just use sql queries to rename tables (e.g. drop table/rename), because then the cartodb dashboard won't work. you have to use their gui interface
also insert into ... select * from ... doesn't work.

you can prevent your visualizations from being deleted by adding a blank layer to viz. but be sure to delete it afterwards!

upload replacement table
change numerical data types to numbers (mostly ids) (note the dates.date should be a string)
change private to public
delete original table on cartodb
rename replacement table to name of original table
