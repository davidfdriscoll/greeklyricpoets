replacing tables

you can't just use sql queries to rename tables (e.g. drop table/rename), because then the cartodb dashboard won't work. you have to use their gui interface
also insert into ... select * from ... doesn't work.

you can prevent your visualizations from being deleted by adding a blank layer to viz. but be sure to delete it afterwards (especially important with the lines)! 

upload replacement table
change numerical data types to numbers (mostly ids) (note the dates.date should be a string) (looks like converter does a better job of this than it used to)
change private to public
delete original table on cartodb
rename replacement table to name of original table
